# AssetValidation
Asset validation is an essential process to ensure that your project's assets are error-free, properly configured, and meet the engine's requirements. Asset validation helps maintain the stability and performance of the project.

It will validates assets when you import them or when you open a project. It checks for issues such as missing files, incorrect references, incorrect naming conventions or incompatible settings.
