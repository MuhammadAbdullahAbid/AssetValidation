# Project Asset Validation

Asset validation is a crucial process in ensuring the error-free integration of assets into your project. Properly configured assets that meet the engine's requirements contribute to the stability and performance of your project.

## Purpose

The primary goals of asset validation are to:

- Identify and rectify missing files
- Correct incorrect references
- Enforce proper naming conventions
- Ensure compatibility with project settings

## When Does Validation Occur?

Asset validation occurs in two key instances:

1. **Importing Assets:**
   - Assets are validated when imported into the project.
   - This helps catch issues at the time of asset integration.

2. **Opening a Project:**
   - Validation is triggered when opening the project.
   - This ensures ongoing integrity, especially if assets have been modified or updated externally.

## Validation Checks

During the asset validation process, the system checks for the following:

- **Missing Files:**
  - Identifies assets with missing or incomplete files.

- **Incorrect References:**
  - Flags assets with references that do not match the expected configuration.

- **Naming Conventions:**
  - Ensures that assets adhere to the specified naming conventions.

- **Compatibility Settings:**
  - Verifies that assets are configured in a way that is compatible with the project's requirements.

## How to Resolve Issues

If validation flags any issues, it is essential to address them promptly. Common steps for resolution include:

1. **Missing Files:**
   - Locate and add the missing files to the project.

2. **Incorrect References:**
   - Update references to match the correct configuration.

3. **Naming Conventions:**
   - Rename assets to align with the established naming conventions.

4. **Compatibility Settings:**
   - Adjust the settings of the asset to ensure compatibility.
